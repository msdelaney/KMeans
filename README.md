Mall Clustering Example
The point of this project is to see how much of the entire clustering example can be automated
We lose some accuracy using the elbow method. The next iteration will have a +- 1 n_cluster check against silhouette score to see if that helps

The big piece of taking the final clusters and fitting them to random forest classifiers
We are able to check the feature importance and see what are the most important attributes of those clusters, adding more science in persona statements
